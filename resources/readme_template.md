# ISS TLE Observations

This repo contains a list of images showing Transient [Luminous Events (TLEs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning) captured from the International Space Station (ISS).

## Image processing

All images in this repository were processed with Adobe Lightroom with very similar settings to make them more appealing to look at, but still keep a very consistent appearance:

* Color profile: `Adobe Color`
* Whitebalance set to `Daylight` or alternatively moonlit clouds in the scene
* `Exposure`, `Shadows`, `Highlights`, etc. slightly adjusted to show fully dynamic range
* Noise reduction: [Lightroom AI denoise](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/04/18/denoise-demystified) at 10-20% strength, sometimes also traditional denoise
* Lens corrections: Vignette correction, No distortion correction (causes fringes on noisy images)
